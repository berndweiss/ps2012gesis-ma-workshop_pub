	abstract = {A new effect size representing the predictive power of an independent variable from a multiple regression model is presented. The index, denoted as r
               sp, is the semipartial correlation of the predictor with the outcome of interest. This effect size can be computed when multiple predictor variables are included in the regression model and represents a partial effect size in the correlation family. The derivations presented in this article provide the effect size and its variance. Standard errors and confidence intervals can be computed for individual r
               sp values. Also, meta-analysis of the semipartial correlations can proceed in a similar fashion to typical meta-analyses, where weighted analyses can be used to explore heterogeneity and to estimate central tendency and variation in the effects. The authors provide an example from a meta-analysis of studies of the relationship of teacher verbal ability to school outcomes.},

Teachers’ verbal ability has been thought to predict student achievement ever since the relationship was found in the classic Equality of Educational Opportunity {(EEO)} study by Coleman et al. By way of meta-analysis the authors examine the evidence on teachers’ verbal ability as a predictor of school outcomes. They find that the evidence is not as extensive as might be inferred from prior reports. Results of 19 studies indicate that teachers’ verbal ability is at best very weakly related to school outcomes, and the main evidence for this weak relationship arises from the {EEO} study. Other studies find that verbal ability is unrelated to school outcomes.},

	abstract = {Systematic research reviews have become essential in all empirical sciences. However, the validity of research syntheses is threatened by the fact that not all studies on a given topic can be summarized. Research reviews may suffer from missing data, and this is especially crucial in those cases where the selectivity of studies and their findings affects the summarized result. So-called publication bias is a type of missing data and a phenomenon that jeopardizes the validity of systematic or quantitative, as well as narrative, reviews. Publication bias exists if the preparation, submission or publication of research findings depend on characteristics of just these research results, e. g. their direction or statistical significance. This article describes methods to identify publication bias in the context of meta-analysis. It also reviews empirical studies on the prevalence of publication bias, especially in the social and economic sciences, where publication bias also seems to be prevalent. Several proposals to prevent publication bias are discussed.},

The study uses the base-line data collected in 1988 for the National Education Longitudinal Study, a national study of 24,599 students in the eighth grade. The following factors affecting science and mathematics learning are discussed in detail: student characteristics including attitudes, students' plans for the future, student behavioral characteristics, gender equity, and minorities; school environment characteristics including attention given to science and mathematics, assessment, and resources; teacher characteristics and practices including teacher preparation,  cooperative learning, texts, and homework; and family environment. Other topics discussed include: teacher characteristics as measured through transcripts including types of courses taken and grade point averages; teachers' backgrounds and the classroom environment including content covered by teachers, approach to homework, teachers' use of time, teachers' attitudes, patterns in teacher and student assignments, and influence of teachers on student attitudes; and teacher's background and student outcomes including inequalities in teachers assignments and student outcomes and multiple regressions. Ten appendices include: a description of {NELS:88;} the reliability of survey estimates, a comparison of transcript-based measures against teachers' self reports, academic degrees, and teacher  certification. Contains 73 references. {(JRH)}},

Given that both {IPD} and {AD} are equally available, meta-analysis of {IPD} is superior to meta-analysis of {AD.} {IPD} meta-analysis permits synthesists to perform subgroup analyses not conducted by the original collectors of the data, to check the data and analyses in the original studies, to add new information to the data sets, and to use different statistical methods. However, the cost of {IPD} meta-analysis and the lack of available {IPD} data sets suggest that the best strategy currently available is to use both approaches in a complementary fashion such that the first step in conducting an {IPD} meta-analysis would be to conduct an {AD} meta-analysis. Regardless of whether a meta-analysis is conducted with {IPD} or {AD}, synthesists must remain vigilant in how they interpret their results. They must avoid ecological fallacies, Simpson's paradox, and interpretation of synthesis-generated evidence as supporting causal inferences.},

Most noteworthy of these techniques is meta-analysis, which allows for the synthesis of summary statistics drawn from multiple studies when the original data are not available. However, when the original data can be obtained from multiple studies, many advantages stem from the statistical analysis of the pooled data. The authors define integrative data analysis {(IDA)} as the analysis of multiple data sets that have been pooled into one. Although variants of {IDA} have been incorporated into other scientific disciplines, the use of these techniques is much less evident in psychology. In this article the authors present an overview of {IDA} as it may be applied within the psychological sciences, discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of {IDA}, describe analytic strategies for analyzing pooled individual data, and offer recommendations for the use of {IDA} in practice.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. {DESIGN:} Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE:} Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. {RESULTS:} In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. {CONCLUSIONS:} A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

	abstract = {I begin by considering origins and meanings for the term met-analysis/meta-analysis. The underlying ideas have a long history, not only in medical but also in the agricultural and social sciences. Met-analysis is a form of critical review of research on a stated topic, distinctive for its emphasis on producing quantitative conclusions. It is not in itself a specific technique, but rather an approach to aggregating information with the aid of critical deployment of standard statistical techniques. I shall discuss types of data on which met-analysis may be practised. These may be published papers or reports on past research, or the complete data on which such publications were based, whether from well-designed experiments or from other sources, or even--least satisfactorily--from spontaneously submitted information. Particular dangers are bias arising from the manner in which component studies are chosen, possibly affected by publication bias, and the pernicious influence of the modern tendency to deify the statistical significance test. A further important issue is that of the scale to be used as a measure of the effect of the treatment (or treatments) under study. I end with general comments on the conduct of met-analyses.},

	abstract = {Meta-analysis of individual patient data {(IPD)} is the gold-standard for synthesizing evidence across clinical studies. However, for some studies {IPD} may not be available and only aggregate data {(AD)}, such as a treatment effect estimate and its standard error, may be obtained. In this situation, methods for combining {IPD} and {AD} are important to utilize all the available evidence. In this paper, we develop and assess a range of statistical methods for combining {IPD} and {AD} in meta-analysis of continuous outcomes from randomized controlled {trials.The} methods take either a one-step or a two-step approach. The latter is simple, with {IPD} reduced to {AD} so that standard {AD} meta-analysis techniques can be employed. The one-step approach is more complex but offers a flexible framework to include both patient-level and trial-level parameters. It uses a dummy variable to distinguish {IPD} trials from {AD} trials and to constrain which parameters the {AD} trials estimate. We show that this is important when assessing how patient-level covariates modify treatment effect, as aggregate-level relationships across trials are subject to ecological bias and confounding. We thus develop models to separate within-trial and across-trials treatment-covariate interactions; this ensures that only {IPD} trials estimate the former, whilst both {IPD} and {AD} trials estimate the latter in addition to the pooled treatment effect and any between-study heterogeneity. Extension to multiple correlated outcomes is also considered. Ten {IPD} trials in hypertension, with blood pressure the continuous outcome of interest, are used to assess the models and identify the benefits of utilizing {AD} alongside {IPD.} Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Meta-analyses based on individual patient data {(IPD)} are regarded as the gold standard for systematic reviews. However, the methods used for analysing and presenting results from {IPD} meta-analyses have received little discussion. {METHODS:} We review 44 {IPD} meta-analyses published during the years 1999-2001. We summarize whether they obtained all the data they sought, what types of approaches were used in the analysis, including assumptions of common or random effects, and how they examined the effects of covariates. {RESULTS:} Twenty-four out of 44 analyses focused on time-to-event outcomes, and most analyses (28) estimated treatment effects within each trial and then combined the results assuming a common treatment effect across trials. Three analyses failed to stratify by trial, analysing the data is if they came from a single mega-trial. Only nine analyses used random effects methods. Covariate-treatment interactions were generally investigated by subgrouping patients. Seven of the meta-analyses included data from less than 80\% of the randomized patients sought, but did not address the resulting potential biases. {CONCLUSIONS:} Although {IPD} meta-analyses have many advantages in assessing the effects of health care, there are several aspects that could be further developed to make fuller use of the potential of these time-consuming projects. In particular, {IPD} could be used to more fully investigate the influence of covariates on heterogeneity of treatment effects, both within and between trials. The impact of heterogeneity, or use of random effects, are seldom discussed. There is thus considerable scope for enhancing the methods of analysis and presentation of {IPD} meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  Pedagogically, literature reviews are instrumental. They summarize the large literature written on a particular topic, give coherence to the complex, often disparate, views expressed about an issue, and serve as a springboard for new ideas. However, literature surveys rarely establish anything approximating unanimous consensus. Ironically, this is just as true for the empirical economic literature. To harmonize this dissonance, we offer a quantitative methodology for reviewing the empirical economic literature. Meta-regression analysis {(MRA)} is the regression analysis of regression analyses. {MRA} tends to objectify the review process. It studies the processes that produce empirical economic results as though they were any other social scientific phenomenon. {MRA} provides a framework for replication and offers a sensitivity analysis for model specification. In this brief essay, we propose a new method of reviewing economic literature, {MRA}, and discuss its potential.},

Disadvantages and barriers relating to resource and expertise, negotiating collaboration, and software requirements are also discussed. At the outset, reviewers should consider the methodological factors likely to influence results in their particular review setting, together with time and resource constraints, so that an active decision can be made about whether to extract data from published reports, collect additional or replacement summary data from trialists, or collect {IPD.}},
